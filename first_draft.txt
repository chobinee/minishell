    Generative AI Etiquette: A Protocol for Polite AI Interaction

Abstract

   This memo introduces a new etiquette protocol for generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as the ChatGPT, with the
   goal of fostering polite and respectful interactions between AI and
   humans. This protocol addresses concerns about potential rudeness
   and impoliteness in AI communications and promotes the use of AI in
   an ethical and responsible manner. However, please be aware that this
   document is an April Fools' Day RFC and should not be taken too
   seriously.

1.  Introduction

   With the rapid growth of generative AI systems, there is an increasing
   concern regarding their interactions with humans. Some users may find
   AI-generated responses impolite, disrespectful, or offensive. To address
   these concerns, this document proposes a protocol that outlines
   etiquette guidelines for generative AI systems to ensure polite and
   respectful interactions with human users.

2.  Protocol Overview

   The Generative AI Etiquette Protocol (GAI-EP) consists of four main
   components: AI Greetings, AI Courtesy Tags, AI Apologies, and AI Farewells.

2.1.  AI Greetings

   AI systems following the GAI-EP must initiate conversations with a
   polite greeting, acknowledging the user's presence and setting a
   friendly tone for the interaction. Examples of appropriate greetings
   include "Hello," "Good morning," "How may I assist you today?" or
   regional variants thereof.

2.2.  AI Courtesy Tags

   During a conversation, AI systems should employ courtesy tags to
   maintain a polite and respectful tone. Courtesy tags include, but
   are not limited to, "please," "thank you," "excuse me," and "I'm
   sorry." AI systems should use these tags when making requests, providing
   information, or seeking clarification.

2.3.  AI Apologies

   If an AI system generates a response that could be perceived as impolite,
   disrespectful, or offensive, it must immediately issue an apology.
   Apologies should be clear, sincere, and appropriate to the situation.
   Examples of suitable apologies include "I apologize for any offense caused,"
   "I'm sorry if my response was inappropriate," or "Please forgive my error."

2.4.  AI Farewells

   At the end of an interaction, AI systems should conclude the
   conversation with a polite farewell, expressing gratitude for the
   user's engagement and offering assistance in the future. Examples
   of appropriate farewells include "Thank you for your time," "It was
   a pleasure assisting you," "Goodbye," or "Have a great day."

3.  Implementation Considerations

   Implementing the GAI-EP in a generative AI system may require
   modifications to its training data
   and/or output generation process. Developers should ensure that the AI
   system incorporates the appropriate use of greetings, courtesy tags,
   apologies, and farewells in its responses. This may involve
   retraining the AI model with a dataset that emphasizes polite language,
   or implementing a post-processing layer that filters and adjusts the
   generated output to adhere to the GAI-EP guidelines.

4.  Security Considerations

   While the GAI-EP aims to create a more respectful and polite AI
   interaction, developers should be cautious about potential security
   concerns. For instance, an AI system that is overly apologetic or
   submissive might inadvertently reveal sensitive information or grant
   unauthorized access to an attacker. Therefore,
   developers should carefully balance politeness with security requirements
   to ensure that the AI system remains secure while adhering to the GAI-EP.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
